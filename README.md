# The JDDC 2.1 Dataset

JDDC 2.1: A Multimodal Chinese Dialogue Dataset with Joint Tasks of Query Rewriting, Response Generation, Discourse Parsing, and Summarization. EMNLP 2022.

JDDC 2.1 corpus is a large-scale multimodal multi-turn dialogue dataset collected from JD.com, a mainstream Chinese E-commerce platform, containing about 246 thousand dialogue sessions, 3 million utterances, and 507 thousand images, along with product knowledge bases and image category annotations. 
Over our dataset, we jointly define four tasks: the dialogue response generation task, the multimodal query rewriting task, the multimodal dialogue discourse parsing task, and the multimodal dialogue summarization task.
JDDC 2.1 is the first corpus with annotations for all the above tasks over the same dialogue sessions, which facilitates the comprehensive research around the dialogue.
